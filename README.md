MACHINE LEARNING MODELS USED:

• SVM (Support Vector Machine):
An initial approach employed a Support Vector Machine for gender classification in images. The model's performance was promising, although the attained accuracy score of around 84% fell short of expectations.

• Logistic Regression:
Subsequently, the task involved using Logistic Regression for classification. This approach faced similar challenges as the SVM, with the achieved accuracy also falling below the desired threshold.

• Random Forest Classifier:
In an attempt to address the shortcomings of the previous methods, the Random Forest classifier was introduced. Unfortunately, this model yielded an accuracy of only about 70%, leading to incorrect gender predictions when analyzing random images.

• K-Neighbors Classifier:
As a final endeavor, the K-Neighbors Classifier was applied to the gender classification task. This model demonstrated moderate performance, showing slight improvements in terms of reducing incorrect gender predictions compared to the previous attempts.



Overall, the journey through these different machine learning models for gender classification highlighted the challenges of image-based classification tasks. Despite making lesser accuracy, the results underscored the importance of feature extraction and selection in optimizing model performance.
